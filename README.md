# Digital Character Recognition using YOLO
This repo is about performing OCR(Optical Character Recognition) using the Yolo11x model. The Yolo11 model is finetuned for Digital Characters displayed on the LCD monitor.
The fine-tuned model can recognize the digital characters on the LCD monitor.The model is fine-tuned only for some of the characters like(A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,=,%,*,-,+,.,/).It can also recognize alphanumeric characters and some of the symbols.
